# nqueen
The N-Queen problem.

<h1>Background</h1>

This repository is my investigation into a specific algorithm for solving the N-Queen problem.

This was also my first Python coding project. The repo has a complete history of my development of the project from when I started with no knowledge of Python, and using a simple text editor, until later when I was using IntelliJ.
You can follow that history through the comments on the commits.

<h1>The Algorithm</h1>

See the file theory.txt for the original information on the algorithm I'm investigating.
