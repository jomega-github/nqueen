The N-Queen problem.

My investigation into a specific algorithm for solving the N-Queen problem.

This was also my first Python coding project. A complete history of my development of the project from when I started with no knowledge of Python, and using a simple text editor, until later when I was using IntelliJ.

See the file theory.txt for information on the algorithm I'm investigating.
