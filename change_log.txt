* Added timing.
* Added optimization helper matrices.
* Changed some naming of variables to make clear when row and column
were being used.
* New function optimized_under_attack which does a simple test
of the boolean arrays at (sr,sc). This takes out a loop and math test.

  The default is now to not show progress, not show count only,
  not show node count and not show total node count.
* Fixed repeating code by writing new function retreat_wrapper.

- Version 1.0

*Initial version.  My idea was to take a C++ version I wrote for N-Queens

as possible to the C++ version.
